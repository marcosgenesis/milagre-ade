# One desktop window drives every paired computer

Date: 2026-10-08. Status: approved design, awaiting spec review.

## Goal

A Milagre desktop window shows and drives the chats of other Macs running Milagre, next to its own, in one sidebar. The
phone already pairs with several Macs; this brings the same pairing to the desktop, with full desktop parity on a remote
computer: send, stop and continue, approvals and questions, diffs, commit/push/PR, canvas, Links, designs, simulators,
browsers and adding Projects.

Modeled on Paseo (getpaseo/paseo, read at 06fe97c on 2026-10-08): one merged list with the host on each row, the local
machine as just the first host, a footer popover listing hosts with status, and a gear per host that opens its settings.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Sidebar | One merged list of Projects (design `sidebar-c-sections` v6). Each chat row's second line starts with its computer, then its PR chips. No per-computer headers. |
| When rows show the computer | Only with two or more computers. With just this Mac the sidebar is unchanged. |
| Computer status | Footer laptop button opens a popover: each computer with its status dot, route on a second line ("This Mac", "Same network", "relay.milagre.cloud", "Offline, seen 2h ago"), a gear on hover, and Add computer. |
| Scope on a remote computer | Full desktop parity, except actions that only make sense on the machine in front of you (below). |
| Architecture | The remote daemon accepts paired desktops and runs its normal command dispatcher for them. Electron main keeps one channel per computer and routes calls and events by computer id. |
| Pairing | The phone's pairing link and QR, unchanged in format. Add computer takes the pasted link. |
| Transport | Same as the phone: the encrypted LAN route when both Macs share a network, relay.milagre.cloud otherwise. |
| Trust | A paired desktop can do anything the Mac's own window can, except pairing and device management. Removable any time from that Mac. |
| Offline computer | Its Projects and chats stay in the sidebar from a local cache, dimmed and read-only. |
| Phone in this work | The phone sends its name when pairing so Settings › Devices can list it. A merged multi-computer list on the phone is a follow-up. |
| Rollout | Behind Settings › Experimental ("Other computers") until the last PR lands. |

## Screens

All on the Chat's canvas, approved 2026-10-08:

- `sidebar-c-sections` v6: merged list, computer on each chat's second line, popover open, gear tooltip.
- `add-computer` v1: paste the link, the computer it found and how it is reached, "Show it as" name, full-control note.
- `settings-devices` v1: on the other Mac. Replaces Settings › Phone. The on/off switch, Pair a device (QR, Copy link,
  countdown), then Computers and Phones lists, each with status, last seen and Remove. Its "Each link pairs one
  device" line is wrong: any number of devices can pair while the window is open, and the link only changes on Reset.
  The Remove confirm reads "Remove <name>? It can pair again from Pair a device."
- `add-project-remote` v1: choose the computer (offline ones disabled), then browse that computer's folders.
- `computer-settings` v1: what the gear opens for a remote computer. Name (local label only), connection routes and
  which is in use, what lives there, Remove. For This Mac the gear opens Settings › Devices.

Opening a chat of an offline computer shows a banner ("studio is offline. This is the last copy it sent, 2h ago.") and
a disabled composer (`sidebar-c-sections` v3 shows that state).

## Terms

Add **Computer** to `GLOSSARY.md`: a Mac running Milagre whose daemon owns its Projects. "This Mac" is the computer the
window runs on; others are paired computers. **Device** covers phones and computers paired to a Mac.

## Today

- The daemon serves the desktop over a private Unix socket. `apps/daemon/src/server.cjs:335-535` handles each
  connection inline: `wire()` framing, `dispatch()` (383-534, method chain from about 461), per-socket `context.clientId`, `views`, `resultPages`,
  `patchSockets`, and `broadcast()` fan-out (256-272). Nothing there is socket-agnostic.
- Electron main registers every daemon method as a pass-through (`apps/desktop/electron/main.cjs:209-215`) and rebroadcasts
  every event to all windows (184-196). `daemon-runtime.cjs` owns reconnect, resync and state patches.
- Phones pair through `relay-crypto.mjs` (`phoneHello`, `hostAccept`) and talk HTTP-over-channel to the mobile bridge
  (`phone-channels.cjs`), which allows a fixed method list (`mobile-bridge.cjs:22-106`). There is no client kind.
- The Mac remembers phones only as public keys (`relay-identity.cjs:99-130`, `relay-phones.json`, at most 32), so the
  Phone panel shows a count and "Reset all".
- The relay caps frames at 1 MiB and rooms at 16 devices (`apps/relay/src/room.mjs:4-5`). Daemon frames go up to 16 MiB.
- Chat keys are `${scopePath}#${id}` (`packages/shared/src/agent-runs.mjs:16-27`), built or parsed in 17 renderer files.
- ADR-0003: one daemon owns each Project; remote transports "cannot create another writer". This design keeps that: a
  remote computer's Projects are only ever opened by its own daemon.

## The other Mac (daemon)

### Connections

Factor the inline handler into `acceptConnection({ send, end, destroy, isClosed, requireAuthentication, policy })` in
`server.cjs`, returning `{ receive, invalid, close }`. The socket needs `end` and `destroy` separately, `isClosed` for
the late simulator and browser cleanup, and Windows authentication, so a smaller signature cannot keep its behavior. It
owns the connection key, `context.clientId`, the view, result pages, patch subscription, in-flight limits and cleanup
(`runtime.disconnect`). The Unix socket calls it with `wire()`'s `send`; paired desktops call it with a channel `send`.
Behavior over the socket does not change; the existing daemon tests must pass untouched.

`policy` is checked in `dispatch` before the method chain. The socket gets none. Paired desktops get a deny set:

- `phone:*` and `devices:*` (pairing and device management)
- `push:*`
- `daemon:stop`

Everything else is allowed, so a new desktop method works remotely by default. A denied call answers with a typed error
the renderer shows as "Not available on a remote computer".

### Channel

Paired desktops use the phone's routes (relay room and LAN on 8798) and its crypto. Changes in `phone-channels.cjs`:

- The hello's inner JSON gains `kind: "desktop"` and `name`. No `kind` means phone, so existing phones keep working.
- After `hostAccept`, a desktop channel stops speaking HTTP-over-channel. Its messages are `t: "rpc"` (one daemon
  request), `t: "evt"` (one pushed event) and `t: "part"` (a piece of a frame larger than 768 KiB, reassembled in order
  by `id` and index, capped at the daemon's 16 MiB frame limit).
- The channel opens a virtual connection with `acceptConnection` and the desktop policy, and closes it when the channel
  closes.
- Pairing still happens only through the relay inside the 10-minute window; the LAN still refuses unknown keys.

### Devices store

Replace `relay-phones.json` with `devices.json`: `{ devices: [{ key, kind: "phone" | "computer", name, pairedAt,
lastSeen }], removed: [{ key, removedAt }] }`, mode 0600. On first read, existing phone keys migrate as `{ kind: "phone",
name: null }` and show as "Phone", and the old file is deleted. `MAX_DEVICES` stays 32. `isKnown` and `add` keep their
shapes; every accepted hello updates the name (so migrated phones pick theirs up) and `lastSeen` (written at most once
a minute). The hello says `kind: "desktop"`; the store records that device as `kind: "computer"`.

The pairing check becomes per device: a key in `removed` cannot pair again inside a pairing window that was already
open when it was removed. Without this, a removed phone redials and re-pairs within seconds, because showing the QR in
Settings opens the window.

New methods, socket only (they are in the deny set): `devices:list` and `devices:remove(key)`. Remove deletes the entry,
adds it to `removed` and closes that device's open channels on the relay and the LAN. Known limits: push registrations
are keyed by an id the phone makes, not its pairing key, so a removed phone keeps receiving push until Reset; phones on
a Cloudflare tunnel use the bearer token and are not listed. "Reset all" stays as the existing rotate-identity action.

### Remote-only helpers

- `fs:list-dirs({ path })`: folder names, whether each is a git repo and its branch, and whether it is already a
  Project. Starts at the home folder; refuses paths outside it. Feeds the remote folder picker.
- `media:read({ path })`: the bytes of an image or file a chat references, limited to files the daemon already serves to
  the phone (`attachment-preview.cjs` rules). Replaces `milagre-media://` for remote chats.

## This Mac (Electron main)

### Computers

A new `apps/desktop/electron/computers.cjs`:

- `computers.json` in userData: `[{ id, hostId, name, relay, lanRoutes, addedAt }]`. The pinned host key and the
  desktop's own keypair live in the keychain through `safeStorage`.
- One transport per computer: `createRelayTransport` from `apps/mobile/src/relay-transport.ts`, moved to
  `packages/shared` with its socket and random sources injected (Node's global `WebSocket` and `crypto`), plus the pure
  route supervisor from `apps/mobile/src/routes.ts`. LAN first, relay otherwise, re-checked on connect, every 60 s and on
  network change.
- One remote runtime per computer, reusing `daemon-runtime.cjs` with the channel in place of the socket: the same
  reconnect, `eventSeq` watermark, paged snapshot and state-patch resync.
- Pairing: Add computer parses the link with `parsePairing` (`apps/mobile/src/pairing.ts`, moved to `packages/shared`
  with the transport), accepts only relay links, opens the relay channel with a hello carrying `kind: "desktop"` and
  the Mac's name, and saves the computer once `hostAccept` answers.

### Routing

- Renderer calls name their computer: `window.milagre.on(computerId).invoke(method, args)`. The existing flat
  `window.milagre.*` calls stay as shorthands for `local`, so untouched screens keep working.
- Events reach the renderer tagged `{ computerId, channel, payload }`.
- Local-only handlers stay local and are hidden for remote chats: `editor:open`, `project:reveal`, `skills:open`,
  `skills:reveal`, the `project:open` folder dialog (replaced by the remote folder picker), image copy/save menus that
  read local paths (they fetch through `media:read` first), notifications settings, updates.
- OS notifications for a remote computer's chats go through the existing `AttentionNotifier`, labeled with the
  computer.

### Offline cache

Each computer's last sidebar state and the transcripts of its last 20 opened chats are written to
`userData/computers/<id>/cache.sqlite` when they arrive, and read when the computer is offline. Removing a computer
deletes its folder.

## Renderer

- A chat's identity becomes `{ computerId, key }`. `local` is this Mac, and local keys are unchanged, so drafts,
  pinned chats and settings keep their stored keys. Remote keys are stored as `${computerId}|${key}`.
- Central changes: `@milagre/shared/agent-runs` (key helpers take an optional computer), `state-events.ts` (one state
  per computer and scope), `sidebar-scopes.ts` (scopes from every computer, merged by Project name order), and
  `chat-messages.ts`, `draft-store.ts`. `App.tsx` reads the selected chat's computer and routes through it.
- Sidebar (`SidebarNav.tsx`, `sidebar/ChatRow.tsx`): with two or more computers, every chat row is two lines and the
  second line starts with a laptop icon and the computer name, then the PR chips. An offline computer's Projects and
  rows are dimmed and its rows read "studio, offline".
- Footer: a laptop button (beside Add project and Link projects) opens the computers popover. The gear opens Computer
  settings, a new Settings section per computer.
- Add project asks for the computer first when there is more than one.
- A denied or local-only action is hidden on remote chats rather than shown disabled.

## Phone

- The phone's hello sends `name`: `Device.deviceName` from `expo-device` (already linked at `~57.0.2` and used by
  `push-native.ts`, so the fingerprint does not change; confirm with the fingerprint check). iOS 16 and later return a
  generic "iPhone" without an entitlement that needs a native build, so the phone falls back to `Device.modelName`
  ("iPhone 16 Pro"). JS only, shipped as an OTA.
- Copy that says "Settings → Phone" (`relay-transport.ts`, `pairing.ts`, `client.ts`, `app/index.tsx`,
  `add-computer.tsx`) becomes "Settings → Devices", as do `notifications.cjs`, the docs and the help skill.
- Nothing else changes on the phone in this work.

## Errors

- A computer that stops answering: its dot turns amber ("Reconnecting…"), then grey ("Offline, seen 2h ago") after 30 s.
  Its rows dim and read-only mode starts; queued sends are refused with "studio is offline".
- Removed on the other Mac: `hostAccept` refuses with `unknown-phone`; the computer shows "Removed on studio. Pair
  again with a new link." and its cache stays until removed here.
- A pairing link past its 10 minutes: "This link expired. Copy a new one on studio."
- Version skew: a daemon from before PR 1 ignores `kind`, accepts a desktop hello as a phone and closes the channel on
  the first `rpc` message. PR 1's daemons refuse a desktop hello with `reason: "kind"`. Either way the window shows
  "Update Milagre on studio to connect." Only daemons with `desktop-peer-v1` (PR 2) accept desktops.
- Relay room full (16 devices): "studio has too many devices connected. Remove one in its Settings › Devices."

## Testing

- Unit: frame splitting and reassembly (order, gaps, the 16 MiB cap), the deny set, the devices store migration and
  remove, hello `kind` handling (missing kind is a phone).
- Daemon: the existing socket tests unchanged; a virtual connection gets events, patches and result pages the same way.
- End to end: two throwaway daemons with separate data folders and a local relay (as in the relay e2e), a paired
  desktop that lists Projects, sends a message, gets the reply, and is refused `devices:remove`.
- Electron checks: `test-sidebar-computers.cjs` (merged list, second line only with two computers, offline dimming,
  popover and gear) and `test-add-computer.cjs` (paste, found computer, errors), against a fake remote runtime.
- Manual: this Mac and a second Mac (or a second user account) on the same network and apart, with the phone still
  paired to both.

## Order of work

Each step is its own PR, behind the Experimental flag until step 4 lands.

1. `acceptConnection` refactor, the devices store with migration, `devices:list`/`devices:remove`, Settings › Devices
   on desktop, the phone sending its name (OTA).
2. The paired-desktop channel: hello `kind`, `rpc`/`evt`/`part` messages, the deny set, `desktop-peer-v1`, end-to-end
   test.
3. `computers.cjs`, the shared transport move, Add computer, the footer popover, Computer settings.
4. The multi-computer renderer: identity, routing, the sidebar's second line, remote limits, the offline cache.
5. `fs:list-dirs` with the remote folder picker, and `media:read` for remote images and files.

## Out of scope

- A merged multi-computer list on the phone.
- Direct `host:port` or SSH connections (Paseo's Direct and SSH methods).
- Sharing Accounts between computers; Accounts stay on their own computer (ADR-0005).
- Links that span Projects on different computers.
