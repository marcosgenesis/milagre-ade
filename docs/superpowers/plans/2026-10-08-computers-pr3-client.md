# Computers PR 3a: Allow, and the Desktop's Computer Client Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** A Mac holds a new computer's first pairing until its owner clicks Allow in its window, and Electron main gains `computers.cjs`: the client that pairs with another Mac from its link, keeps one remote daemon runtime per paired computer over the LAN or the relay, and reports each computer's status. No screen adds a computer yet (that is PR 3b).

**Architecture:** On the daemon, `phone-channels.cjs` parks a desktop's first hello (sending `0x05 {"t":"pending"}` notices) and asks `phone.cjs`, which keeps the requests and broadcasts `devices:pending` to this Mac's own window; `devices:allow` / `devices:deny` answer them, and a prompt in the window calls those. On the desktop, `peer-client.cjs` speaks the paired-desktop protocol (hello `kind: "desktop"`, then `rpc` / `evt` / `part` from `@milagre/shared/peer-frames`) and presents the same interface as `@milagre/daemon/client`'s `connect`, so `daemon-runtime.cjs` runs over it unchanged except for a new `connect` option (reach a host, never start, flush, stop or restart it). `computers.cjs` ties pairing, the saved list (`computers.json`), the keychain-sealed keys (`computer-keys.json` via `safeStorage`) and the route supervisor, moved to `@milagre/shared` with `parsePairing`.

**Tech Stack:** Node 24 CommonJS daemon and Electron main (`node:test`, `node:assert/strict`), ESM `.mjs` + `.d.mts` in `@milagre/shared`, `tweetnacl` channels, `ws` on the daemon and Node's global `WebSocket` on the desktop, React 19 + Tailwind in the renderer, Electron 44 checks driven by Vite fixtures.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-computers-design.md` (step 3 of "Order of work", plus "Allowing a new computer"). Earlier plans: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-08-computers-pr1-devices.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-08-computers-pr2-channel.md`.

## Scope and the split

Step 3 of the spec plus Allow is 16 tasks, past what one reviewer can hold. It splits in two PRs, each one shippable:

- **PR 3a (this plan):** Allow end to end on the paired Mac (daemon, prompt, notification), the shared move, `peer-client.cjs`, the computers store and keys, `daemon-runtime.cjs`'s `connect` option, `computers.cjs`, and an end-to-end test with a real daemon, a local relay and the real `computers.cjs`. Shipping it alone closes the hole the Allow decision is about (PR 2 lets anyone holding the token pair a full-control computer); with no screen to add a computer, nothing new is visible except the prompt.
- **PR 3b (listed at the end):** Electron main wiring and IPC, Settings › Experimental "Other computers", the footer popover, Add computer, Computer settings.

The prompt sits in 3a rather than 3b: it is the paired Mac's half of the Allow gate, its Electron check runs against the real daemon from Tasks 1-3, and a 3a that held hellos with no way to answer them could never pair a computer.

## Global Constraints

- If the worktree has no `node_modules`, run `npm install` before Task 1.
- Daemon and Electron main code is CommonJS `.cjs`; tests use `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`. Shared code is ESM `.mjs` with a `.d.mts` beside it and a `"./name": { types, default }` entry in `packages/shared/package.json` (the daemon and Electron main `require()` them, as they do `@milagre/shared/relay-crypto`).
- One unit file: `node --test <path>`. One workspace: `npm test -- --unit --workspace <shared|daemon|desktop|mobile>`. All unit tests: `npm test -- --unit`. One Electron check: `npm test -- --only <name>`.
- Allow, verbatim from the spec: "A new computer's first pairing waits for Allow on the Mac being paired. Phones pair as before." The prompt reads "studio wants to drive this Mac's chats" with Allow and Deny. "Deny refuses it with `reason: "denied"` and saves nothing. A request that gets no answer within the pairing window, or whose channel closes, is dropped. Known computers reconnect without asking." `devices:pending` goes to this Mac's own window only ("never to desktops: `devices:*` is denied").
- Error copy, verbatim from the spec's "Errors": "Removed on studio. Pair again with a new link.", "This link expired. Copy a new one on studio.", "Update Milagre on studio to connect.", "studio has too many devices connected. Remove one in its Settings › Devices."
- `computers.json` in userData: `[{ id, hostId, name, relay, lanRoutes, addedAt }]` plus `lastSeen` (for "Offline, seen 2h ago" across launches). "The pinned host key and the desktop's own keypair live in the keychain through `safeStorage`", and so does each computer's pairing token (every hello carries it).
- Transport: "LAN first, relay otherwise, re-checked on connect, every 60 s and on network change." A computer that stops answering is "Reconnecting…", then "Offline" after 30 s.
- Rollout: `computers.cjs` connects nothing until `setEnabled(true)`, which PR 3b calls from Settings › Experimental "Other computers" (default off). PR 3a wires nothing of it into `main.cjs`. The Allow prompt is not behind the flag: the computer asking has it on, this Mac may not.
- Desktop and mobile sync: the phone gets nothing new in PR 3a or 3b (the spec: "A merged multi-computer list on the phone is a follow-up"; the phone never pairs computers or shows Allow). Its only change is Task 5's move of `parsePairing` and the route supervisor into `@milagre/shared`, with no behavior change: JS only, the fingerprint must not change, and the phone ships it as an OTA after merge (Task 11).
- The relay caps frames at 1 MiB and rooms at 16 devices (`apps/relay/src/room.mjs:4-5`), closing a socket it turns away with 4404 (no Mac) or 4429 (room full) (`room.mjs:107-111`), and one the Mac closes with 1000 (`room.mjs:158-160`).
- Every task that changes a payload the window reads or a screen runs that screen's Electron check (PR 2 broke `test-settings-devices` by skipping it). Checks start their own Vite and Electron with their own ports and profiles; never kill Milagre by name.
- Commits: conventional messages, no Claude or Anthropic co-author trailer or footer, ever. The pre-commit hook runs `oxlint` and `oxfmt --check` on staged files: run `npx oxfmt <files>` before `git add`.

## Review Focus

- A held hello that waits minutes for Allow: the hello timer (15 s, `phone-channels.cjs:314-316`) would drop it, and an idle relay socket can time out. The Mac repeats its pending notice every 20 s and the desktop treats each as a sign of life. Pinned in Task 1 (the hello outlasts `helloMs` with notices) and Task 6 (the desktop waits).
- The owner clicks Allow after the computer gave up (its socket closed): nothing may be saved and no daemon connection opened, and the window hears the request is gone. Pinned in Task 2 (a dropped request can't be allowed) and Task 3 (end to end, `devices:allow` answers "no longer waiting" and `devices:list` stays as it was).
- A computer removed on the Mac it drives while this desktop is connected: its runtime must stop redialing the relay with hellos that are refused, and say "Removed on studio. Pair again with a new link." Pinned in Task 10.
- A Mac from before PR 1 takes the desktop's hello as a phone's and closes on the first `rpc`: this must read as "Update Milagre on studio to connect.", not a network failure. Pinned in Task 6.
- Pasting a link for a computer already added, or this Mac's own link: refused with words that say so, before any socket opens. Pinned in Task 9.

Not moved: `apps/mobile/src/relay-transport.ts`. The spec moves `createRelayTransport` to `packages/shared`, but it is the phone's HTTP-over-channel client (`req`/`res`/`live`, `relay-transport.ts:138-186` and `354-369`) and its socket, randomness and timers are already injected (`relay-transport.ts:35-37`). A desktop speaks `rpc`/`evt`/`part`; the only part the two share is the ~40-line handshake. Making the transport's protocol pluggable would rewrite the phone's most important file for no phone gain, and need a full phone re-test. `peer-client.cjs` instead mirrors its handshake and timing (15 s hello, 20 s ping, 45 s silence, 4404) with a comment pointing at it.

### Task 1: The hello waits for Allow

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/phone-channels.cjs:1-19` (constants), `:43` (options), `:61-70` (`dropConn`), `:77-132` (`hello`), `:299-317` (the record)
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/relay-host.cjs:12-20`, `:33-49`
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs:209-310` (`connectDesktop`)
- Test: `apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `hostAccept` (`@milagre/shared/relay-crypto`), `openPeerChannel` (PR 2).
- Produces: `createPhoneChannels({ ..., allowComputer, pendingRepeatMs })` and `startRelayHost({ ..., allowComputer, timing: { pendingRepeatMs } })`, where `allowComputer({ key: string, name: string | null, signal: AbortSignal, waiting: () => void }) => Promise<"allowed" | "denied" | "expired" | "busy" | "dropped">`. It calls `waiting()` once when it holds the request. Refusals: denied `{ t: "error", code: "unknown-phone", reason: "denied" }`, busy `{ ..., reason: "busy" }`, expired or no `allowComputer` `{ t: "error", code: "unknown-phone" }`. The pending notice is the raw frame `0x05` + `{"t":"pending"}`, sent outside the channel (not yet open), now and every `pendingRepeatMs` (20 s).
- Produces (test kit): `connectDesktop(...).hello({ ms })` waits through notices (each restarts its `ms`), and `desktop.notices` lists them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Teach the test kit's desktop to wait through pending notices**

In `apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs`, inside `connectDesktop`, replace the `hello()` method with:

```js
    /** Resolves with the channel, or with { error } when the Mac refused the hello. Waits through pending notices (Allow). */
    async hello({ ms = 5000 } = {}) {
      await opened;
      const { message, ephemeral } = phoneHello({ phone: key, host: identity.box.publicKey, token, random, name, kind: "desktop" });
      const reply = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let timer;
        const arm = () => {
          clearTimeout(timer);
          timer = setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timed out waiting for the hello's reply")), ms);
        };
        arm();
        onReply = (bytes) => {
          // A computer's first hello waits for Allow; the Mac says so, and again every few seconds.
          if (bytes[0] === 0x05) {
            desktop.notices.push(JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(bytes.subarray(1))));
            arm();
            return;
          }
          clearTimeout(timer);
          onReply = null;
          resolve(bytes);
        };
        ws.send(message);
      });
      if (reply[0] === 0x04) return { error: JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(reply.subarray(1))) };
      channel = phoneFinish({ ephemeral, phone: key, host: identity.box.publicKey, reply });
      for (const bytes of early.splice(0)) take(bytes);
      return { channel };
    },
```

and add `notices: [],` to the `desktop` object, after `error: null,`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Let the test Mac take an `allowComputer`, allowing by default**

In `apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs`, replace the first line of `startMac` and its `startRelayHost` call's `openPeer,` line:

```js
async function startMac(
  t,
  { relayUrl, bridgeUrl, canPair = () => false, token = TOKEN, timing, onStatus, openPeer, allowComputer = async () => "allowed", WebSocket } = {},
) {
```

```js
    openPeer,
    allowComputer,
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing tests**

Append to `apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs`:

```js
/** An owner who answers when the test says: each request is recorded, and `answer(verdict)` settles the latest. */
function owner() {
  const asked = [];
  return {
    asked,
    allowComputer: (request) =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        asked.push({ ...request, answer: resolve });
        request.waiting();
      }),
    answer: (verdict) => asked.at(-1).answer(verdict),
  };
}

test("a computer's first hello waits for Allow, and only then is saved and gets its daemon connection", async (t) => {
  const daemon = fakePeerDaemon();
  const you = owner();
  const { relay, mac } = await paired(t, { mac: { openPeer: daemon.openPeer, allowComputer: you.allowComputer } });
  const desktop = connectDesktop({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity: mac.identity, name: "studio" });
  t.after(() => desktop.close());
  const hello = desktop.hello({ ms: 10_000 });
  await until(() => desktop.notices.length > 0, "the pending notice");
  assert.deepEqual(desktop.notices[0], { t: "pending" });
  assert.deepEqual(
    you.asked.map(({ key, name }) => [key, name]),
    [[b64url(desktop.key.publicKey), "studio"]],
  );
  assert.equal(mac.phones.count(), 0, "nothing saved before Allow");
  assert.equal(daemon.connections.length, 0, "no daemon connection before Allow");
  assert.deepEqual(mac.host.connectedKeys(), [], "a waiting computer isn't connected");
  you.answer("allowed");
  assert.ok((await hello).channel);
  assert.deepEqual(
    mac.phones.list().map((device) => [device.kind, device.name]),
    [["computer", "studio"]],
  );
  assert.deepEqual((await desktop.call("daemon:status")).result, { echo: [] });
});

test("Deny, a request past its window and a busy Mac turn the computer away with their reasons, saving nothing", async (t) => {
  for (const [verdict, error] of [
    ["denied", { t: "error", code: "unknown-phone", reason: "denied" }],
    ["expired", { t: "error", code: "unknown-phone" }],
    ["busy", { t: "error", code: "unknown-phone", reason: "busy" }],
  ]) {
    const daemon = fakePeerDaemon();
    const { relay, mac } = await paired(t, { mac: { openPeer: daemon.openPeer, allowComputer: async () => verdict } });
    const desktop = connectDesktop({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity: mac.identity });
    t.after(() => desktop.close());
    assert.deepEqual(await desktop.hello(), { error }, verdict);
    assert.equal(mac.phones.count(), 0, verdict);
    assert.equal(daemon.connections.length, 0, verdict);
  }
});

test("a phone pairs as before and a known computer reconnects, neither asking", async (t) => {
  const asked = [];
  const daemon = fakePeerDaemon();
  const { relay, mac, connect } = await paired(t, {
    mac: {
      openPeer: daemon.openPeer,
      allowComputer: async (request) => {
        asked.push(request.key);
        return "allowed";
      },
    },
  });
  await connect();
  const desktop = connectDesktop({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity: mac.identity });
  t.after(() => desktop.close());
  assert.ok((await desktop.hello()).channel);
  assert.equal(asked.length, 1, "the computer's first pairing asked");
  const again = connectDesktop({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity: mac.identity, key: desktop.key });
  t.after(() => again.close());
  assert.ok((await again.hello()).channel);
  assert.equal(asked.length, 1, "its reconnect did not");
});

test("a held hello outlasts the hello timeout, hearing a notice every few seconds", async (t) => {
  const daemon = fakePeerDaemon();
  const you = owner();
  const { relay, mac } = await paired(t, {
    mac: { openPeer: daemon.openPeer, allowComputer: you.allowComputer, timing: { helloMs: 200, pendingRepeatMs: 40 } },
  });
  const desktop = connectDesktop({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity: mac.identity });
  t.after(() => desktop.close());
  const hello = desktop.hello({ ms: 10_000 });
  await sleep(600);
  assert.ok(desktop.notices.length >= 3, `notices: ${desktop.notices.length}`);
  you.answer("allowed");
  assert.ok((await hello).channel, "still open after three hello timeouts");
});

test("a computer that leaves while it waits drops its request", async (t) => {

  desktop.close();
  await until(() => you.asked[0].signal.aborted, "the request dropped");
  assert.equal(mac.phones.count(), 0);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL. The new tests time out waiting for "the pending notice" or get a channel at once; the older desktop tests still pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Hold a computer's first hello in `phone-channels.cjs`**

Below `const ERROR_MARK = 0x04;` add:

```js
// Sent before a computer's first hello is answered: the Mac is waiting for its owner's Allow (phone.cjs).
const PENDING_MARK = 0x05;
// Repeated while the owner decides, so the desktop knows the Mac is still there and the relay doesn't drop an idle socket.
const PENDING_REPEAT_MS = 20_000;
```

and below `const encoder = new TextEncoder();`:

```js
const PENDING_NOTICE = new Uint8Array([PENDING_MARK, ...encoder.encode('{"t":"pending"}')]);
// What a refused computer hears for each answer that isn't Allow; "expired" and "dropped" add nothing to unknown-phone.
const NOT_ALLOWED = { denied: { reason: "denied" }, busy: { reason: "busy" } };
```

Add to the doc comment above `createPhoneChannels`, after its last sentence:

```js
 * A computer's first hello waits for `allowComputer({ key, name, signal, waiting })` (phone.cjs), which resolves
 * "allowed", "denied", "expired", "busy" or "dropped" and calls `waiting()` once it holds the request.
```

Replace the signature line with:

```js
function createPhoneChannels({
  identity,
  phones,
  token,
  bridgeUrl,
  canPair,
  retired = false,
  WebSocket,
  fetch: fetchBridge,
  random,
  helloMs,
  openPeer,
  allowComputer,
  pendingRepeatMs = PENDING_REPEAT_MS,
}) {
```

In `dropConn`, after `clearTimeout(record.helloTimer);` add:

```js
    // A computer still waiting for Allow: its request goes with its channel.
    record.abort?.abort();
```

Above `async function hello(`, add:

```js
  /**
   * Holds a computer's first hello until this Mac's owner answers. The channel stays open with no daemon connection;
   * the desktop hears PENDING_NOTICE (outside the channel, which isn't open yet) now and every pendingRepeatMs, and
   * anything it sends meanwhile drops it (onFrame only reads open channels). No `allowComputer`: no one can say yes.
   */
  async function waitForAllow(current, conn, record, accepted) {
    if (!allowComputer) return "expired";
    record.state = "pending";
    clearTimeout(record.helloTimer);
    const abort = new AbortController();
    record.abort = abort;
    const notice = () => sendFrame(current, DATA, conn, PENDING_NOTICE);
    try {
      return await allowComputer({
        key: accepted.phoneKey,
        name: accepted.name,
        signal: abort.signal,
        waiting() {
          notice();
          record.pendingTimer = setInterval(notice, pendingRepeatMs);
        },
      });
    } catch {
      return "dropped";
    } finally {
      clearInterval(record.pendingTimer);
      record.pendingTimer = null;
      record.abort = null;
    }
  }
```

In `hello()`, replace:

```js
    // Set before any wait, so a removal that lands meanwhile finds this channel.
    record.key = accepted.phoneKey;
    if (accepted.firstPairing) {
```

with:

```js
    // Set before any wait, so a removal that lands meanwhile finds this channel.
    record.key = accepted.phoneKey;
    // A computer's first pairing waits for its owner's Allow on this Mac; nothing is saved before it.
    if (accepted.firstPairing && kind === "computer") {
      const verdict = await waitForAllow(current, conn, record, accepted);
      if (current.conns.get(conn) !== record) return;
      if (verdict !== "allowed") return refuse(current, conn, "unknown-phone", NOT_ALLOWED[verdict]);
    }
    if (accepted.firstPairing) {
```

In `onFrame`, add to the new record, after `peer: null,`:

```js
        abort: null,
        pendingTimer: null,
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Pass `allowComputer` and `pendingRepeatMs` through the relay host**

In `apps/daemon/src/relay-host.cjs`, add `pendingRepeatMs: 20_000,` to `DEFAULT_TIMING` after `helloMs: 15_000,`, add `allowComputer,` to `startRelayHost`'s parameters after `openPeer,`, and replace its first two lines of body with:

```js
  const { pingMs, idleMs, helloMs, backoff, replacedMs, stableMs, jitter, pendingRepeatMs } = { ...DEFAULT_TIMING, ...timing };
  const channels = createPhoneChannels({
    identity,
    phones,
    token,
    bridgeUrl,
    canPair,
    retired,
    WebSocket,
    fetch: fetchBridge,
    random,
    helloMs,
    openPeer,
    allowComputer,
    pendingRepeatMs,
  });
```

The LAN host needs neither: it never pairs (`canPair: () => false`, `lan-host.cjs:58`).

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs apps/daemon/src/lan-host.test.cjs`
Expected: PASS (every test in both files).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt apps/daemon/src/phone-channels.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-host.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs
git add apps/daemon/src/phone-channels.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-host.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-host.test.cjs
git commit -m "feat(daemon): a computer's first hello waits for Allow"
```

### Task 2: Phone access keeps the waiting requests

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/phone.cjs:17-27` (constants), `:48-92` (options, `peer`), `:205-212` (`teardown`), `:370-379` (returned methods)
- Test: `apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 1's `allowComputer` contract.
- Produces: `createPhone({ ..., onPending })` with `onPending(requests)` on every change; the relay host gets `allowComputer` with `openPeer` (none on a confined phone). New methods: `pendingDevices(): Array<{ key, name, at }>` (oldest first), `allowDevice(key)` and `denyDevice(key)`, each returning `pendingDevices()` after the answer and throwing `"That computer is no longer waiting. Ask it to pair again."` for a key that isn't waiting. A request expires when the pairing window open at its hello closes; a second request from the same key replaces the first ("dropped"); past `MAX_PENDING_COMPUTERS = 4` the hello is "busy"; turning phone access off, a reset or a close drops them all.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs`, replace the test "the relay and LAN hosts get openPeer, and a confined phone never hosts a desktop" with:

```js
test("the relay and LAN hosts get openPeer and allowComputer, and a confined phone never hosts a desktop", async (t) => {
  const openPeer = () => ({ receive() {}, invalid() {}, close() {} });
  const open = await fixture(t, { phoneOptions: { openPeer } });
  await open.phone.setEnabled(true);
  await open.phone.settled();
  assert.equal(open.relays[0].options.openPeer, openPeer);
  assert.equal(typeof open.relays[0].options.allowComputer, "function");
  assert.equal(open.lans[0].options.openPeer, openPeer);
  const confined = await fixture(t, { phoneOptions: { openPeer, allowedRoot: "/tmp/milagre-demo" } });
  await confined.phone.setEnabled(true);
  await confined.phone.settled();
  assert.equal(confined.relays[0].options.openPeer, undefined);
  assert.equal(confined.relays[0].options.allowComputer, undefined);
  assert.equal(confined.lans.length, 0);
});
```

and append:

```js
/** Phone access on, with every pending list it announced, and a way to ask as a computer's hello does. */
async function asking(t, options = {}) {
  const announced = [];
  const fixed = await fixture(t, { ...options, phoneOptions: { openPeer: () => ({}), onPending: (list) => announced.push(list) } });
  await fixed.phone.setEnabled(true);
  await fixed.phone.settled();
  const ask = (key, name = null) => {
    const abort = new AbortController();
    const request = { waited: false, abort };
    request.verdict = fixed.relays[0].options.allowComputer({
      key,
      name,
      signal: abort.signal,
      waiting: () => {
        request.waited = true;
      },
    });
    return request;
  };
  return { ...fixed, announced, ask };
}

test("a new computer waits for its owner: listed, then allowed or denied", async (t) => {
  const { phone, announced, ask } = await asking(t);
  const studio = ask("deskA", "studio");
  const nameless = ask("deskB");
  assert.equal(studio.waited && nameless.waited, true, "both told to wait");
  assert.deepEqual(phone.pendingDevices(), [
    { key: "deskA", name: "studio", at: 0 },
    { key: "deskB", name: null, at: 0 },
  ]);
  assert.deepEqual(
    announced.at(-1).map((request) => request.key),
    ["deskA", "deskB"],
  );
  assert.deepEqual(
    phone.allowDevice("deskA").map((request) => request.key),
    ["deskB"],
  );
  assert.equal(await studio.verdict, "allowed");
  assert.deepEqual(phone.denyDevice("deskB"), []);
  assert.equal(await nameless.verdict, "denied");
  assert.deepEqual(announced.at(-1), []);
  assert.throws(() => phone.allowDevice("deskA"), /no longer waiting/);
  assert.throws(() => phone.denyDevice("nope"), /no longer waiting/);
});

test("a request expires with the pairing window it arrived in, and one after the window isn't held at all", async (t) => {
  const { phone, clock, ask } = await asking(t);
  clock.now = PAIRING_WINDOW_MS - 30;
  const late = ask("deskA", "studio");
  assert.equal(late.waited, true);
  assert.equal(await late.verdict, "expired");
  assert.deepEqual(phone.pendingDevices(), []);
  clock.now = PAIRING_WINDOW_MS;
  const after = ask("deskB", "lab");
  assert.equal(await after.verdict, "expired");
  assert.equal(after.waited, false, "never shown");
});

test("a request whose computer left is dropped, and a late Allow finds nothing", async (t) => {
  const { phone, announced, ask } = await asking(t);
  const gone = ask("deskA", "studio");
  gone.abort.abort();
  assert.equal(await gone.verdict, "dropped");
  assert.deepEqual(announced.at(-1), []);
  assert.throws(() => phone.allowDevice("deskA"), /no longer waiting/);
});

test("a computer's second hello replaces its first request, and a fifth computer at once is busy", async (t) => {
  const { phone, ask } = await asking(t);
  const first = ask("deskA", "studio");
  const second = ask("deskA", "studio");
  assert.equal(await first.verdict, "dropped");
  assert.deepEqual(
    phone.pendingDevices().map((request) => request.key),
    ["deskA"],
  );
  for (const key of ["deskB", "deskC", "deskD"]) ask(key);
  const fifth = ask("deskE");
  assert.equal(await fifth.verdict, "busy");
  assert.equal(fifth.waited, false);
  assert.equal(phone.pendingDevices().length, 4);
  phone.allowDevice("deskA");
  assert.equal(await second.verdict, "allowed");
});

test("turning phone access off drops every waiting request", async (t) => {
  const { phone, ask } = await asking(t);
  const waiting = ask("deskA", "studio");
  await phone.setEnabled(false);
  await phone.settled();
  assert.equal(await waiting.verdict, "dropped");
  assert.deepEqual(phone.pendingDevices(), []);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL with `TypeError: fixed.relays[0].options.allowComputer is not a function` (and `phone.pendingDevices is not a function`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Keep the requests in `phone.cjs`**

Below `const PHONE_KEY = /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$/;` add:

```js
// Computers waiting for Allow at once; more are turned away ("busy") so a leaked link can't flood the window's prompt.
const MAX_PENDING_COMPUTERS = 4;
const NOT_WAITING = "That computer is no longer waiting. Ask it to pair again.";
```

Add to the doc comment above `createPhone`, after "desktop where to reach this Mac.":

```js
 * A computer's first pairing waits for its owner: `allowComputer` (handed to the relay host with `openPeer`) holds the
 * request until `allowDevice` or `denyDevice`, the end of the pairing window it arrived in, or its channel closing.
 * `onPending(requests)` hears the list of waiting `{ key, name, at }` after each change; `pendingDevices()` reads it.
```

Add `onPending = () => {},` to `createPhone`'s parameters after `onPaired = () => {},`, and replace:

```js
  // What the relay and LAN hosts get to serve paired desktops: nothing on a confined phone.
  const peer = openPeer && allowedRoot === undefined ? { openPeer } : {};
```

with:

```js
  // What the relay and LAN hosts get to serve paired desktops: nothing on a confined phone.
  const peer = openPeer && allowedRoot === undefined ? { openPeer, allowComputer } : {};
  /** Computers waiting for Allow, by key, oldest first: { key, name, at, settle(verdict) }. */
  const pending = new Map();
  const pendingList = () => [...pending.values()].map(({ key, name, at }) => ({ key, name, at }));
  function pendingChanged() {
    try {
      onPending(pendingList());
    } catch {
      /* a listener must not break the setting */
    }
  }
  /**
   * Holds a computer's first hello (phone-channels.cjs) until its owner answers. It expires when the pairing window
   * open at its hello closes; its channel closing (`signal`) or a second hello from the same key drops it.
   */
  function allowComputer({ key, name = null, signal, waiting }) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      if (signal?.aborted) return resolve("dropped");
      const left = pairingUntil - now();
      if (left <= 0) return resolve("expired");
      pending.get(key)?.settle("dropped");
      if (pending.size >= MAX_PENDING_COMPUTERS) return resolve("busy");
      const entry = { key, name, at: now(), settle };
      const timer = setTimeout(() => settle("expired"), left);
      const onAbort = () => settle("dropped");
      signal?.addEventListener("abort", onAbort, { once: true });
      function settle(verdict) {
        if (pending.get(key) !== entry) return;
        pending.delete(key);
        clearTimeout(timer);
        signal?.removeEventListener("abort", onAbort);
        pendingChanged();
        resolve(verdict);
      }
      pending.set(key, entry);
      waiting?.();
      pendingChanged();
    });
  }
  function answerPending(key, verdict) {
    const entry = pending.get(key);
    if (!entry) throw new Error(NOT_WAITING);
    entry.settle(verdict);
    return pendingList();
  }
```

In `teardown()`, add as its first line:

```js
    // Their channels close with the hosts; a request whose channel outlives this run must not be answerable.
    for (const entry of [...pending.values()]) entry.settle("dropped");
```

In the returned object, after `devices,` add:

```js
    /** Computers waiting for Allow, oldest first. */
    pendingDevices: () => pendingList(),
    /** Lets a waiting computer pair; returns the ones still waiting. */
    allowDevice: (key) => answerPending(key, "allowed"),
    /** Turns a waiting computer away; returns the ones still waiting. */
    denyDevice: (key) => answerPending(key, "denied"),
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs`
Expected: PASS (every test in the file).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt apps/daemon/src/phone.cjs apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs
git add apps/daemon/src/phone.cjs apps/daemon/src/phone.test.cjs
git commit -m "feat(daemon): phone access keeps computers waiting for Allow"
```

### Task 3: The daemon asks its own window

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/server.cjs:24` (`DEVICE_METHODS`), `:384-391` (`createPhone`), `:548-550` (dispatch)
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs` (add `startTestMac`)
- Modify: `apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs:1-79` (use `startTestMac`)
- Test: `apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs`, `apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2's `pendingDevices`, `allowDevice`, `denyDevice`, `onPending`.
- Produces: event `devices:pending` with payload `{ requests: Array<{ key: string, name: string | null, at: number }> }`, to policy-less connections only (the broadcast filter at `server.cjs:309` already skips `devices:*` for paired desktops). Methods, socket only (`devices:` is in the deny set, `peer-policy.cjs:4`): `devices:pending()`, `devices:allow(key)`, `devices:deny(key)`, each resolving the list still waiting.
- Produces (test kit): `startTestMac(t, { autoAllow = true, lan = true }) => Promise<{ clock, client, project, identity, token, dial, relay, dataDir }>`. With `autoAllow` the Mac's own client allows every request it hears; with `lan: false` the Mac has no LAN listener.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing server test**

Append to `apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs`:

```js
/** A daemon whose relay host is a stand-in that only records its options, and this Mac's window connected to it. */
async function withRelays(t) {
  const dataDir = await fs.realpath(await fs.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "milagre-devices-")));
  const relays = [];
  const daemon = await startDaemon({
    dataDir,
    version: "test",
    phoneOptions: {
      localPort: 0,
      lanPort: null,
      startRelay: (options) => {
        relays.push(options);
        return { close: async () => {}, status: () => "online" };
      },
    },
    runtimeOptions: {
      cwd: dataDir,
      environmentReady: Promise.resolve(),
      titleModels: {},
      agentCli: Object.assign(async () => ({ command: null }), { invalidate() {} }),
    },
  });
  const desktop = await connect({ dataDir });
  t.after(async () => {
    desktop.close();
    await daemon.close();
    await fs.rm(dataDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
  });
  return { desktop, relays };
}

test("a computer waiting for Allow reaches this Mac's window as devices:pending, answered by devices:allow and devices:deny", async (t) => {
  const { desktop, relays } = await withRelays(t);
  const heard = [];
  desktop.on("event", ({ channel, payload }) => {
    if (channel === "devices:pending") heard.push(payload.requests);
  });
  const methods = (await desktop.call("daemon:status")).methods;
  for (const method of ["devices:pending", "devices:allow", "devices:deny"]) assert.ok(methods.includes(method), method);
  assert.deepEqual(await desktop.call("devices:pending"), []);
  await desktop.call("phone:set-enabled", [true]);
  await waitFor(async () => (await desktop.call("phone:status")).state === "on");
  const ask = (key, name) => relays[0].allowComputer({ key, name, signal: new AbortController().signal, waiting() {} });
  const studio = ask("s".repeat(43), "studio");
  const lab = ask("l".repeat(43), "lab");
  await waitFor(() => heard.at(-1)?.length === 2);
  assert.deepEqual(
    (await desktop.call("devices:pending")).map((request) => request.name),
    ["studio", "lab"],
  );
  assert.deepEqual(
    (await desktop.call("devices:allow", ["s".repeat(43)])).map((request) => request.name),
    ["lab"],
  );
  assert.equal(await studio, "allowed");
  assert.deepEqual(await desktop.call("devices:deny", ["l".repeat(43)]), []);
  assert.equal(await lab, "denied");
  await waitFor(() => heard.at(-1)?.length === 0);
  await assert.rejects(desktop.call("devices:allow", ["s".repeat(43)]), /no longer waiting/);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL with `AssertionError: devices:pending` (the method isn't listed).

- [ ] **Step 3: Serve the methods and the event**

In `apps/daemon/src/server.cjs`, replace `DEVICE_METHODS` with:

```js
// Paired phones and computers, listed and removed from this Mac's own window only (Settings > Devices), and the
// computers waiting for its Allow.
const DEVICE_METHODS = Object.freeze(["devices:list", "devices:remove", "devices:pending", "devices:allow", "devices:deny"]);
```

In the `createPhone({...})` call, after `onPaired: (info) => broadcast("phone:paired", info),` add:

```js
    // Only this Mac's window hears it: paired desktops are never sent devices:* events (see broadcast).
    onPending: (requests) => broadcast("devices:pending", { requests }),
```

In `dispatch`, after the `devices:remove` branch add:

```js
        else if (request.method === "devices:pending") result = phone.pendingDevices();
        else if (request.method === "devices:allow") result = phone.allowDevice(request.args[0]);
        else if (request.method === "devices:deny") result = phone.denyDevice(request.args[0]);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it to verify it passes**

Run: `node --test apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Move the throwaway Mac into the test kit, allowing by default**

In `apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs`, add above `module.exports`:

```js
/**
 * A throwaway Mac: its own data folder, a local relay in place of relay.milagre.cloud, the LAN on a port the OS picks
 * on 127.0.0.1 (none with `lan: false`), and a clock the test moves (pairing windows). Never Victor's data folder, 8797
 * or 8798. `autoAllow`: this Mac's window allows every computer that asks, as its owner would.
 */
async function startTestMac(t, { autoAllow = true, lan = true } = {}) {
  const fs = require("node:fs/promises");
  const os = require("node:os");
  const path = require("node:path");
  const { execFileSync } = require("node:child_process");
  const { startDaemon } = require("./server.cjs");
  const { connect } = require("./client.cjs");
  const { readIdentity } = require("./relay-identity.cjs");
  const directory = await fs.realpath(await fs.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "peer-e2e-")));
  const dataDir = path.join(directory, "profile");
  const project = path.join(directory, "project");
  await fs.mkdir(project);
  const clock = { now: 1_000_000 };
  const sockets = [];
  let daemon;
  let client;
  // Registered before the relay's own hook, so the daemon closes while the relay still answers; the folder goes last.
  t.after(async () => {
    for (const socket of sockets) socket.close();
    client?.close();
    try {
      await daemon?.close();
    } finally {
      await fs.rm(directory, { recursive: true, force: true, maxRetries: 5, retryDelay: 100 });
    }
  });
  execFileSync("git", ["init", "-b", "main", project], { stdio: "ignore" });
  const relay = await startLocalRelay(t);
  daemon = await startDaemon({
    dataDir,
    version: "9.8.7",
    runtimeOptions: { cwd: project, environmentReady: Promise.resolve(), titleModels: {}, readPullRequests: async (_worktree, refs) => refs },
    phoneOptions: {
      relayUrl: relay.url,
      localPort: 0,
      lanPort: lan ? 0 : null,
      lanHostname: "127.0.0.1",
      addresses: () => ["127.0.0.1"],
      now: () => clock.now,
    },
  });
  client = await connect({ dataDir });
  if (autoAllow)
    client.on("event", ({ channel, payload }) => {
      if (channel !== "devices:pending") return;
      for (const request of payload?.requests ?? []) void client.call("devices:allow", [request.key]).catch(() => {});
    });
  // Turning phone access on opens the pairing window, as showing the QR in Settings › Devices does.
  await client.call("phone:set-enabled", [true]);
  await until(async () => {
    const status = await client.call("phone:status");
    return status.state === "on" && status.relay === "online";
  }, "phone access on and the relay online");
  const identity = await readIdentity(dataDir);
  const token = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(path.join(dataDir, "mobile.json"), "utf8")).token;
  /** Dials this Mac with `connectTo` (connectDesktop or connectPhone), through the relay unless `relayUrl` says otherwise. */
  const dial = (connectTo, options = {}) => {
    const socket = connectTo({ relayUrl: relay.url, identity, token, ...options });
    sockets.push(socket);
    return socket;
  };
  return { clock, client, project, identity, token, dial, relay, dataDir };
}
```

and add `startTestMac,` to `module.exports` after `fakePeerDaemon,`.

In `apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs`, delete `macWithRelay` (lines 32-79) and the imports it alone used, so the head of the file reads:

```js
const { test } = require("node:test");
const assert = require("node:assert/strict");
const { b64url } = require("@milagre/shared/relay-crypto");
const { startTestMac, connectDesktop, connectPhone, until } = require("./relay-test-kit.cjs");
```

and replace each `await macWithRelay(t)` with `await startTestMac(t)`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the failing end-to-end test**

Append to `apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs`:

```js
test("a new computer waits for Allow, which only this Mac's window hears; Deny saves nothing, and a late Allow finds nothing", async (t) => {
  const mac = await startTestMac(t, { autoAllow: false });
  const heard = [];
  mac.client.on("event", ({ channel, payload }) => {
    if (channel === "devices:pending") heard.push(payload.requests);
  });
  const waitingFor = (key) => until(() => heard.at(-1)?.some((request) => request.key === key), "the window to hear the request");

  // A computer the owner allows.
  const known = mac.dial(connectDesktop, { name: "known" });
  const knownHello = known.hello({ ms: 10_000 });
  const knownKey = b64url(known.key.publicKey);
  await waitingFor(knownKey);
  await until(() => known.notices.length > 0, "the waiting notice");
  assert.deepEqual(await mac.client.call("devices:list"), [], "nothing saved before Allow");
  await mac.client.call("devices:allow", [knownKey]);
  assert.ok((await knownHello).channel);

  // Another asks: the window hears it, the computer already connected doesn't, and it can't answer for this Mac.
  const studio = mac.dial(connectDesktop, { name: "studio" });
  const studioHello = studio.hello({ ms: 10_000 });
  const studioKey = b64url(studio.key.publicKey);
  await waitingFor(studioKey);
  assert.deepEqual(
    (await mac.client.call("devices:pending")).map((request) => [request.key, request.name]),
    [[studioKey, "studio"]],
  );
  assert.deepEqual((await known.call("devices:allow", [studioKey])).error, { code: "NOT_AVAILABLE_REMOTELY", message: "Not available on a remote computer" });
  await known.call("daemon:status");
  assert.deepEqual(
    known.frames.filter((frame) => frame.event?.channel?.startsWith("devices:")),
    [],
  );
  await mac.client.call("devices:deny", [studioKey]);
  assert.deepEqual(await studioHello, { error: { t: "error", code: "unknown-phone", reason: "denied" } });
  assert.deepEqual(
    (await mac.client.call("devices:list")).map((device) => device.key),
    [knownKey],
  );

  // One that leaves before the owner answers: its request goes, and Allow afterwards changes nothing.
  const late = mac.dial(connectDesktop, { name: "late" });
  void late.hello({ ms: 2000 }).catch(() => {});
  const lateKey = b64url(late.key.publicKey);
  await waitingFor(lateKey);
  late.close();
  await until(() => heard.at(-1)?.length === 0, "the request to go");
  await assert.rejects(mac.client.call("devices:allow", [lateKey]), /no longer waiting/);
  assert.equal((await mac.client.call("devices:list")).length, 1);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the daemon tests**

Run: `npm test -- --unit --workspace daemon`
Expected: PASS (the moved helper keeps the older end-to-end tests green, `autoAllow` answering their computers).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt apps/daemon/src/server.cjs apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs
git add apps/daemon/src/server.cjs apps/daemon/src/server-devices.test.cjs apps/daemon/src/relay-test-kit.cjs apps/daemon/src/peer-e2e.test.cjs
git commit -m "feat(daemon): devices:pending, devices:allow and devices:deny for this Mac's window"
```

### Task 4: The Allow prompt

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/desktop/app/src/lib/pending-computers.ts`, `apps/desktop/app/src/lib/pending-computers.test.ts`
- Create: `apps/desktop/app/src/components/ComputerAllowPrompt.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/desktop/app/src/App.tsx:1` (import), `:2209-2214` (`AppWithUpdates`)
- Modify: `apps/desktop/app/src/electron.d.ts:91-101` (types), `:341-345` (methods)
- Modify: `apps/desktop/electron/preload.cjs:223-229`
- Modify: `apps/desktop/electron/notifications.cjs:17-35`, `:128-157`, `apps/desktop/electron/notifications.test.cjs`
- Modify: `apps/desktop/electron/main.cjs:187`
- Create: `scripts/test-allow-computer.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 3's `devices:pending` event and methods. `main.cjs` already registers every host method as a pass-through (`main.cjs:209-215`) and sends every host event to the windows (`main.cjs:193-195`).
- Produces: `window.milagre.listPendingDevices(): Promise<PendingComputer[]>`, `allowDevice(key)`, `denyDevice(key)` (each resolving the ones still waiting), `onDevicesPending(callback: (payload: { requests: PendingComputer[] }) => void): () => void`; type `PendingComputer = { key: string; name: string | null; at: number }`. `AttentionNotifier.notifyComputerWaiting(requests)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing copy test**

Create `apps/desktop/app/src/lib/pending-computers.test.ts`:

```ts
import { test } from "node:test";
import assert from "node:assert/strict";
import { allowQuestion } from "./pending-computers.ts";

test("the prompt names the computer that asks, or says a computer when it sent no name", () => {
  assert.equal(allowQuestion({ name: "studio" }), "studio wants to drive this Mac's chats");
  assert.equal(allowQuestion({ name: null }), "A computer wants to drive this Mac's chats");
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/app/src/lib/pending-computers.test.ts`
Expected: FAIL with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `pending-computers.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the copy**

Create `apps/desktop/app/src/lib/pending-computers.ts`:

```ts
import type { PendingComputer } from "../electron";

In `apps/desktop/app/src/App.tsx`, add after the first import line:

```tsx
import { ComputerAllowPrompt } from "./components/ComputerAllowPrompt";

and replace `AppWithUpdates` with:

```tsx
export default function AppWithUpdates() {
  return (
    <UpdateShell>

      {/* Beside the app, so it asks whatever screen is open, Settings and Links included. */}

}
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the check to verify it passes**

Run: `npm test -- --only test-allow-computer`
Expected: PASS, printing the four `PASS:` lines.

  const { notifier, shown, opened, state } = setup();

  assert.equal(notifier.notifyComputerWaiting([studio]), true);
  assert.equal(shown[0].options.title, "studio wants to drive this Mac's chats");
  assert.equal(shown[0].options.body, "Open Milagre to allow or deny it.");
  shown[0].emit("click");
  assert.deepEqual(opened, ["settings:phone"]);
  // The same request again (another computer joined the list) says nothing more about it.
  const lab = { key: "l".repeat(43), name: null, at: 2 };
  assert.equal(notifier.notifyComputerWaiting([studio, lab]), true);
  assert.equal(shown[1].options.title, "A computer wants to drive this Mac's chats");
  assert.equal(shown[0].closed, true, "one notice at a time");
  assert.equal(notifier.notifyComputerWaiting([studio, lab]), false);
  // Answered: the notice goes.
  assert.equal(notifier.notifyComputerWaiting([]), false);
  assert.equal(shown[1].closed, true);
  // With the window focused the prompt is on screen; no notification.
  state.focused = true;
  assert.equal(notifier.notifyComputerWaiting([{ key: "x".repeat(43), name: "x", at: 3 }]), false);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/electron/notifications.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL with `TypeError: notifier.notifyComputerWaiting is not a function`.

- [ ] **Step 11: Write the notification and wire it**

In `apps/desktop/electron/notifications.cjs`, in the constructor after `this.phonePaired = null;` add:

```js
    /** @type {Electron.Notification | null} */
    this.computerWaiting = null;
    // Keys of the computers waiting for Allow that were already announced.
    this.computersAnnounced = new Set();
```

after `notifyDevicePaired(...) { ... }` add:

```js
  /**
   * Computers waiting for Allow (devices:pending): a new one is announced once, while no Milagre window has focus (the
   * prompt is on screen otherwise). The notice closes when nothing waits any more; its click brings the window back.
   * @param {Array<{ key?: unknown; name?: unknown }>} [requests]
   */
  notifyComputerWaiting(requests = []) {
    const waiting = (Array.isArray(requests) ? requests : []).filter((request) => typeof request?.key === "string");
    const keys = new Set(waiting.map((request) => /** @type {string} */ (request.key)));
    for (const key of this.computersAnnounced) if (!keys.has(key)) this.computersAnnounced.delete(key);
    if (!keys.size) {
      this.computerWaiting?.close();
      this.computerWaiting = null;
      return false;
    }
    const fresh = waiting.find((request) => !this.computersAnnounced.has(/** @type {string} */ (request.key)));
    for (const key of keys) this.computersAnnounced.add(key);
    if (!fresh || this.isAppFocused()) return false;
    const name = capped(fresh.name, MAX_TITLE) || "A computer";

    this.computerWaiting = notification;
    notification.on("click", () => this.openPhoneSettings());
    notification.show();
    return true;
  }
```

and in `closeAll()`, after `this.completionNotifications.clear();` add:

```js
    this.computerWaiting?.close();
    this.computerWaiting = null;
```

In `apps/desktop/electron/main.cjs`, replace:

```js
        if (channel === "phone:paired" && Notification.isSupported()) notifier.notifyDevicePaired(payload?.kind);
```

with:

```js
        // A computer pairs only once its owner clicked Allow here, so only a phone's pairing needs telling.
        if (channel === "phone:paired" && payload?.kind !== "computer" && Notification.isSupported()) notifier.notifyDevicePaired(payload?.kind);
        if (channel === "devices:pending" && Notification.isSupported()) notifier.notifyComputerWaiting(payload?.requests);
```

- [ ] **Step 12: Run the tests and checks**

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/electron/notifications.test.cjs && npm run typecheck && npm test -- --only test-allow-computer && npm test -- --only test-settings-devices`
Expected: PASS for all four.

- [ ] **Step 13: Commit**

### Task 5: The pairing link and the route supervisor move to `@milagre/shared`

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/shared/src/pairing-link.mjs`, `packages/shared/src/pairing-link.d.mts`, `packages/shared/src/pairing-link.test.mjs`
- Create: `packages/shared/src/route-supervisor.mjs`, `packages/shared/src/route-supervisor.d.mts`
- Modify: `packages/shared/package.json` (exports, after `./peer-frames`)
- Modify: `apps/mobile/src/pairing.ts` (whole file), `apps/mobile/src/routes.ts` (whole file), `apps/mobile/src/client.ts:1-8` (imports), `:30-70` (moved definitions)
- Test: `packages/shared/src/pairing-link.test.mjs`; the phone's own `apps/mobile/src/routes.test.ts`, `hosts-store.test.ts`, `client.test.ts` unchanged

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: `@milagre/shared/pairing-link`: `parsePairing(input, { allowLocalRelay }?) => { address, token, name, access?, relay?: { url, hostId, key } }`, `validRelay(value, { allowLocalRelay }?)`, `validAccess`, `localEndpoint`, `relayAddress`, types `Access`, `RelayLink`, `Pairing`. `allowLocalRelay` also takes `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>` (tests only); without it nothing changes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Record the phone's fingerprint before the move**

  now?: () => number;
};
export function createRouteSupervisor<T extends RouteTransport>(options: RouteSupervisorOptions<T>): RouteSupervisor<T>;
```

In `packages/shared/package.json`, after the `"./peer-frames": { ... },` entry add:

```json
    "./pairing-link": {
      "types": "./src/pairing-link.d.mts",
      "default": "./src/pairing-link.mjs"
    },
    "./route-supervisor": {
      "types": "./src/route-supervisor.d.mts",
      "default": "./src/route-supervisor.mjs"
    },
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Point the phone at them**

Replace the whole of `apps/mobile/src/pairing.ts` with:

```ts
// Moved to @milagre/shared so Add computer on the desktop reads the same links.
export { parsePairing } from "@milagre/shared/pairing-link";
export type { Pairing } from "@milagre/shared/pairing-link";
```

Replace the whole of `apps/mobile/src/routes.ts` with:

```ts
// Moved to @milagre/shared so the desktop's computers (apps/desktop/electron/computers.cjs) pick routes the same way.
import type { RouteSupervisor as SharedSupervisor, RouteSupervisorOptions as SharedOptions } from "@milagre/shared/route-supervisor";
import type { RelayTransport } from "./relay-transport.ts";

export { createRouteSupervisor, PROBE_TIMEOUT, HOLD_MS } from "@milagre/shared/route-supervisor";
export type RouteSupervisor = SharedSupervisor<RelayTransport>;
export type RouteSupervisorOptions = SharedOptions<RelayTransport>;
```

In `apps/mobile/src/client.ts`, add after `import type { RelayTransport } from "./relay-transport.ts";`:

```ts
import { localEndpoint, relayAddress, validAccess, validRelay, type Access, type RelayLink } from "@milagre/shared/pairing-link";
```

and replace lines 30-70 (from `/** A Cloudflare Access service token: the edge drops any request to the host's tunnel without it. */` through `export const relayAddress = (hostId: string) => \`relay://${hostId}\`;`) with:

```ts
// The pairing link's parts moved to @milagre/shared with parsePairing; the phone's modules still import them from here.
export { localEndpoint, relayAddress, validAccess, validRelay };
export type { Access, RelayLink };
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the shared and phone tests and typechecks**

Run: `node --test packages/shared/src/pairing-link.test.mjs && npm test -- --unit --workspace mobile && npm run typecheck --workspace @milagre/shared && npm run typecheck --workspace @milagre/mobile && npm run lint --workspace @milagre/mobile`
Expected: PASS for each; the phone's `routes.test.ts`, `hosts-store.test.ts` and `client.test.ts` pass unedited.

- [ ] **Step 8: Confirm the fingerprint did not change**

Run: `cd apps/mobile && npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>console.log(JSON.parse(s).hash))'; cd ../..`
Expected: the same hash as BEFORE. If it differs, stop and report what changed it (apps/mobile/AGENTS.md: a new build needs the user's approval).

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt packages/shared/src/pairing-link.mjs packages/shared/src/pairing-link.d.mts packages/shared/src/pairing-link.test.mjs packages/shared/src/route-supervisor.mjs packages/shared/src/route-supervisor.d.mts packages/shared/package.json apps/mobile/src/pairing.ts apps/mobile/src/routes.ts apps/mobile/src/client.ts

### Task 6: A desktop's channel to a computer

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/desktop/electron/peer-client.cjs`, `apps/desktop/electron/peer-client.test.cjs`
- Create: `apps/desktop/electron/computer-errors.cjs`, `apps/desktop/electron/computer-errors.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `phoneHello`, `phoneFinish`, `fromB64url` (`@milagre/shared/relay-crypto`); `createFrameReader("evt")`, `createFrameWriter("rpc")` (`@milagre/shared/peer-frames`); `deadlineFor` (`@milagre/daemon/client`); `VERSION`, `MAX_PENDING` (`@milagre/daemon/protocol`). Task 1's pending notice.
- Produces: `connectPeer({ url, hostId, hostKey, token, identity, name, onPending?, signal?, random?, createSocket?, timeoutMs? }) => Promise<PeerClient>`, where `PeerClient` is an EventEmitter with `call(method, args?) => Promise<any>`, `close()`, `closed: boolean`, `status: { methods, capabilities, ... }`, emitting `"event"` (`{ channel, payload, seq }`) and `"close"` once: the interface `daemon-runtime.cjs` uses of `@milagre/daemon/client`'s `connect`. `url` is the relay's base or a LAN `ws://address:port`; both serve `/v1/phone?id=<hostId>`. `createSocket(url)` returns a WebSocket-like object (`binaryType`, `onopen`, `onmessage`, `onclose`, `onerror`, `send`, `close`); the default is Node's global `WebSocket`.
- Produces: `PeerError` with `code` one of `denied`, `unknown-phone`, `busy`, `reset`, `bad-token`, `kind`, `bad-hello`, `bad-host`, `outdated`, `full`, `offline`, `lost`, `cancelled`, `keys`, and `final` (true for `denied`, `unknown-phone`, `reset`, `bad-token`, `kind`, `bad-host`, `keys`: retrying can't help).
- Produces: `computerProblem(code, { name, pairing? }) => string`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing copy test**

Create `apps/desktop/electron/computer-errors.test.cjs`:

```js
const test = require("node:test");
const assert = require("node:assert/strict");
const { computerProblem } = require("./computer-errors.cjs");

test("each problem reads as the spec words it, naming the computer", () => {
  const name = "studio";
  const pairing = true;
  assert.equal(computerProblem("unknown-phone", { name }), "Removed on studio. Pair again with a new link.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("unknown-phone", { name, pairing }), "This link expired. Copy a new one on studio.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("outdated", { name }), "Update Milagre on studio to connect.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("kind", { name, pairing }), "Update Milagre on studio to connect.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("full", { name }), "studio has too many devices connected. Remove one in its Settings › Devices.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("denied", { name, pairing }), "studio didn't allow this Mac.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("busy", { name, pairing }), "studio is answering another computer. Try again in a minute.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("reset", { name }), "studio was reset. Pair again with a new link.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("bad-token", { name, pairing }), "This link is out of date. Copy a new one on studio.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("bad-host", { name, pairing }), "This isn't the Mac the link was made on. Copy a new link on studio.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("offline", { name, pairing }), "studio isn't reachable. Open Milagre on it and check Settings › Devices.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("keys", { name }), "This Mac lost its keys for studio. Remove it and pair again.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("lost", { name, pairing }), "Couldn't reach studio. Check your connection and try again.");
  assert.equal(computerProblem("lost", { name }), "studio is offline.");
});
```

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/electron/computer-errors.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL with `Cannot find module './computer-errors.cjs'`.

    default:
      return pairing ? `Couldn't reach ${name}. Check your connection and try again.` : `${name} is offline.`;
  }
}

module.exports = { computerProblem };
```

### Task 7: Saved computers and their keys

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/desktop/electron/computers-store.cjs`, `apps/desktop/electron/computers-store.test.cjs`
- Create: `apps/desktop/electron/computer-keys.cjs`, `apps/desktop/electron/computer-keys.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `helloName`, `b64url`, `fromB64url`, `boxKeyPair` (`@milagre/shared/relay-crypto`); `writePrivate` (`@milagre/daemon/relay-identity`).
- Produces: `createComputersStore({ file, now? })` with `load() => Promise<Computer[]>`, `list()`, `get(id) => Computer | null`, `add({ id, hostId, name, relay }) => Promise<Computer>`, `rename(id, name) => Promise<Computer>` (throws "Give it a name." / "That computer was removed."), `setLanRoutes(id, routes)`, `seen(id)` (file written at most once a minute), `remove(id) => Promise<boolean>`. `Computer = { id, hostId, name, relay, lanRoutes: string[], addedAt, lastSeen }`. Also `lanRoutesFrom(answer, { hostId, hostKey }) => string[] | null` and `LAN_ROUTE`.
- Produces: `createComputerKeys({ file, safeStorage, random })` with `identity() => Promise<KeyPair>` (made once), `secretsOf(id) => Promise<{ hostKey, token } | null>`, `save(id, { hostKey, token })`, `forget(id)`. The file is `{ v: 1, sealed: base64 }`, sealed with `safeStorage.encryptString`.

### Task 8: The runtime drives a host it reaches but doesn't own

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.cjs:43-51` (start), `:196-211` (reconnect), `:332-336` (`restartHost`), `:355-369` (`close`)
- Test: `apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: a `connect() => Promise<DaemonClient>` such as Task 6's `connectPeer`.
- Produces: `connectDesktopRuntime({ connect, emit, dataDir, reconnectMs })`. With `connect`, the first connection and every reconnect come from it; the runtime never starts a host, never calls `daemon:flush` on close, and `restartHost()` and `close({ stopHost: true })` throw. Without it nothing changes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs`:

```js
test("a runtime given `connect` reconnects through it alone, and never starts, flushes, stops or restarts that host", async (t) => {
  const root = await fs.realpath(await fs.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "milagre-remote-runtime-")));
  const project = path.join(root, "project");
  await fs.mkdir(project);
  execFileSync("git", ["init", "-b", "main", project], { stdio: "ignore" });
  const dataDir = path.join(root, "profile");
  const daemon = await startDaemon({ dataDir, version: "test", runtimeOptions: { cwd: project, environmentReady: Promise.resolve(), titleModels: {} } });
  const connections = [];
  const calls = [];
  const connect = async () => {
    const client = await compatibleClient(dataDir);
    const call = client.call.bind(client);
    client.call = (method, args) => {
      calls.push(method);
      return call(method, args);
    };
    connections.push(client);
    return client;
  };
  const events = [];
  const remote = await connectDesktopRuntime({
    dataDir: path.join(root, "not-this-macs-host"),
    connect,
    reconnectMs: 20,
    startHost: async () => {
      throw new Error("must not start a host");
    },
    emit: (channel, payload) => events.push({ channel, payload }),
  });
  t.after(async () => {
    await remote.close().catch(() => {});
    await daemon.close();
    await fs.rm(root, { recursive: true, force: true });
  });
  assert.equal(connections.length, 1);
  assert.ok(remote.methods.includes("project:open"));
  connections[0].close();
  await waitFor(() => events.some((event) => event.channel === "runtime:connection" && event.payload.connected));
  assert.equal(connections.length, 2, "reconnected through connect");
  assert.ok(events.some((event) => event.channel === "runtime:snapshot"), "and read the state again");
  await assert.rejects(remote.restartHost(), /Only this Mac's own host/);
  await assert.rejects(remote.close({ stopHost: true }), /Only this Mac's own host/);
  await remote.close();
  assert.equal(calls.includes("daemon:flush"), false);
  assert.equal(calls.includes("daemon:stop"), false);
  const check = await compatibleClient(dataDir);
  check.close();
  assert.ok(check.status.capabilities.includes("desktop-v1"), "the host still runs");
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `node --test --test-name-pattern "given .connect." apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs`
Expected: FAIL with `Error: must not start a host`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the `connect` option**

In `apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.cjs`, replace the start of `connectDesktopRuntime`:

```js
async function connectDesktopRuntime(options) {
  const { emit = () => {}, dataDir, reconnectMs = 1000 } = options;
  // The start every launch and restartHost use; tests stand in for it.
  /** @type {typeof ensureDaemon} */
  const startHost = options.startHost ?? ensureDaemon;
  /** @type {import('@milagre/daemon/bootstrap').DaemonClient | null} */
  let client = await startHost(options);
```

with:

```js
async function connectDesktopRuntime(options) {
  const { emit = () => {}, dataDir, reconnectMs = 1000 } = options;
  // The start every launch and restartHost use; tests stand in for it.
  /** @type {typeof ensureDaemon} */
  const startHost = options.startHost ?? ensureDaemon;
  // A paired computer's host (computers.cjs) is only reached, through `connect`: this Mac never starts, flushes, stops
  // or restarts it. Without `connect` the runtime drives this Mac's own host.
  const remote = typeof options.connect === "function";
  /** @type {import('@milagre/daemon/bootstrap').DaemonClient | null} */
  let client = remote ? await options.connect() : await startHost(options);
```

In `reconnect()`, replace:

```js
      if (mayStart()) {
```

with:

```js
      if (remote) connection = await options.connect();
      else if (mayStart()) {
```

At the top of `restartHost()`, before `if (closed || restarting) return;`, add:

```js
      if (remote) throw new Error("Only this Mac's own host restarts from here.");
```

In `close()`, replace:

```js
      if (stop) {
```

with:

```js
      if (stop && remote) throw new Error("Only this Mac's own host stops from here.");
      if (stop) {
```

and replace:

```js
      } else if (client && !recovering) await client.call("daemon:flush");
```

with:

```js
      } else if (client && !recovering && !remote) await client.call("daemon:flush");
```

The test's `/Only this Mac's own host/` matches both messages.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the runtime tests**

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs`
Expected: PASS (every test in the file).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.cjs apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs
git add apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.cjs apps/desktop/electron/daemon-runtime.test.cjs
git commit -m "feat(desktop): the daemon runtime can drive a host it only reaches"
```

### Task 9: `computers.cjs`

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/desktop/electron/computers.cjs`, `apps/desktop/electron/computers.test.cjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `connectPeer`, `PeerError` (Task 6); `computerProblem` (Task 6); `createComputersStore`, `lanRoutesFrom` (Task 7); `createComputerKeys` (Task 7); `connectDesktopRuntime` with `connect` (Task 8); `parsePairing` and `createRouteSupervisor`, `PROBE_TIMEOUT` (Task 5); `computerName` (`@milagre/daemon/mobile-pairing`).
- Produces: `createComputers({ dataDir, safeStorage, name?, onChange?, emit?, ownHostId?, allowLocalRelay?, createSocket?, fetch?, now?, random?, reconnectMs?, offlineAfterMs?, checkEveryMs?, networkMs?, backoffMs?, networkSignature? })` returning:
  - `list(): ComputerView[]` with `ComputerView = { id, name, hostId, relayHost, state: "off" | "connecting" | "online" | "reconnecting" | "offline" | "refused", route: "lan" | "relay" | null, lastSeen: number | null, message: string | null, lan: boolean }` (`route` only while online; `lan` once it knows a LAN route).
  - `preview(link): Promise<{ name, hostId, relayHost }>`; throws the words to show.
  - `add(link, { name }, { onPending }): Promise<ComputerView>`; throws the words to show (an `Error` with `code`); `cancelAdd()`.
  - `rename(id, name)`, `remove(id)`, `invoke(id, method, args?)`, `setEnabled(on)`, `close()`.
  - `onChange(list)` after every change; `emit(computerId, channel, payload)` for each runtime event other than `runtime:connection` (PR 4 forwards them to the window).
  PR 3b's `main.cjs` passes `safeStorage` from Electron, `ownHostId` read from the local host's `phone:status` link, and calls `setEnabled` from the "Other computers" setting.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them**

Run: `node --test apps/desktop/electron/computers-e2e.test.cjs`
Expected: PASS (four tests). If one fails, debug the module it points at (Tasks 1-9) before changing the test; the tests are the spec's behavior.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the desktop and daemon unit tests together**

Run: `npm test -- --unit --workspace desktop && npm test -- --unit --workspace daemon`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
npx oxfmt apps/desktop/electron/computers-e2e.test.cjs
git add apps/desktop/electron/computers-e2e.test.cjs
git commit -m "test(desktop): a computer pairs with Allow and runs over the relay and the LAN, end to end"
```

---

### Task 11: Checks before the PR

**Files:** none new.

- [ ] **Step 1: The repo's checks**

Run: `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test -- --unit`
Expected: PASS for all three.

- [ ] **Step 2: The Electron checks for what changed**

Run: `npm test -- --only test-allow-computer && npm test -- --only test-settings-devices && npm test -- --only test-experimental-settings`
Expected: PASS for each (Settings › Devices reads the same payloads as before; the prompt is new).

- [ ] **Step 3: The phone**

Run: `npm run typecheck --workspace @milagre/mobile && npm run lint --workspace @milagre/mobile && npm test -- --unit --workspace mobile`
Expected: PASS. Then compare the fingerprint with the latest TestFlight build, as `apps/mobile/AGENTS.md` says:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate --platform ios | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>console.log(JSON.parse(s).hash))'
npx eas-cli@latest build:list --platform ios --status finished --limit 1 --json --non-interactive | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>console.log(JSON.parse(s)[0].runtimeVersion))'
cd ../..
```

Expected: the two values match. If they don't, stop and report; do not merge.

- [ ] **Step 4: Screenshots of the prompt**

Run: `MILAGRE_SCREENSHOT_DIR="$TMPDIR/computers-allow" npm test -- --only test-allow-computer`
Expected: PASS, with `allow-prompt.png` and `allow-two-waiting.png` in `$TMPDIR/computers-allow`.

Put them on the orphan `screenshots` branch from a temporary worktree (never in this branch):

```bash
git fetch origin screenshots
git worktree add "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots" origin/screenshots
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots/computers-allow"
cp "$TMPDIR/computers-allow/"*.png "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots/computers-allow/"
git -C "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots" add computers-allow
git -C "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots" commit -m "screenshots: computers Allow prompt"
git -C "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots" push origin HEAD:screenshots
git -C "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots" rev-parse HEAD
git worktree remove "$TMPDIR/milagre-screenshots"
```

Link each image in the PR body as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-ptf/milagre-ade/<that sha>/computers-allow/<name>.png`.

- [ ] **Step 5: The PR body says what ships where**

The PR body (no Claude or Anthropic footer) states: the Allow prompt is the only visible change; computers.cjs is not wired into the app until PR 3b; the phone's code moved to `@milagre/shared` with no behavior change and an unchanged fingerprint, so after merge an OTA ships it from `main` with `npm run update:testflight -- --message "Pairing link and route supervisor read from @milagre/shared (no change)"`; and the manual check: on two Macs (or two user accounts), pair with the test kit's raw desktop or wait for 3b.

## PR 3b (follow-up plan; tasks only)

Written after 3a merges, against its merged code.

1. **Main wiring and IPC.** `main.cjs` creates `createComputers({ dataDir: userData, safeStorage, ownHostId: from the local host's phone:status link, onChange: send "computers:changed" to windows })`, closes it in `prepareQuit`, and handles `computers:list`, `computers:preview`, `computers:add` (sends `computers:pending` to the asking window for `onPending`), `computers:cancel-add`, `computers:rename`, `computers:remove`, `computers:projects` (`invoke(id, "project:recent")`), `settings:other-computers` (`setEnabled`). Preload and `electron.d.ts` get `window.milagre.computers.*` and `onComputersChanged`. `npm run typecheck` now checks `computers.cjs` and its modules for the first time (`tsconfig.electron.json` includes `main.cjs`); add JSDoc where it asks. Settings › Experimental gains the "Other computers" switch (`settings.ts` `otherComputers`, default false), pushed to main on change and at launch. Check: `test-experimental-settings.cjs` extended.
2. **The footer popover** (`sidebar-c-sections` v6). `components/sidebar/ComputersButton.tsx`, a laptop button beside Add project and Link projects, shown with "Other computers" on; its popover (portal, `useDismiss` with `follow`, `GlideMenu`, `ScrollArea` per `docs/agents/ui.md`) lists This Mac first, then each computer with its status dot (green online, amber reconnecting, grey offline, red refused), its route on a second line ("This Mac", "Same network", `relay.milagre.cloud`, "Reconnecting…", "Offline, seen 2h ago", or the refusal), a gear on hover with the tooltip "<name> settings: rename, connection, remove" (This Mac's gear opens Settings › Devices), and Add computer. `lib/computers.ts` holds the line and dot logic, unit-tested. Check: `scripts/test-sidebar-computers.cjs` against a fake `window.milagre.computers` (no real runtime), with screenshots.
3. **Add computer** (`add-computer` v1). `components/AddComputerDialog.tsx`: paste the link (Paste reads the clipboard), the steps on the other Mac (Settings › Devices › Pair a device › Copy link), the computer it found and how it is reached (from `preview`), "Show it as" prefilled with its name, the full-control note, Cancel / Add computer; while the other Mac decides, "Waiting for studio to allow this Mac…" with Cancel (`cancelAdd`); every refusal in its words. Check: `scripts/test-add-computer.cjs` (paste, found computer, waiting, each error), screenshots.
4. **Computer settings** (`computer-settings` v1). A Settings section per computer (`SettingsSection` gains `"computer"` with the computer's id): Name (a local label only, renames on blur), Connection (Same network and Relay, each "In use" or "Ready", from `route` and `lan`), what lives there (its Projects from `computers:projects`, or "studio is offline" with its last-seen time), and Remove with "Its chats leave this sidebar and this Mac forgets its keys. Nothing changes on arketa; pair again with a new link." Check: the popover check opens it from the gear, renames and removes, with screenshots.
5. **Checks and screenshots.** Typecheck, lint, unit tests, the three new checks plus `test-settings-devices`, `test-experimental-settings` and `test-sidebar-all-projects`; screenshots on the `screenshots` branch; no phone change (no OTA).

## Self-Review

- **Spec coverage.** "Allowing a new computer": held hello and pending record (Tasks 1-2), `devices:pending` to the window only (Task 3, end to end in Task 3's e2e), the prompt with Allow / Deny (Task 4), Deny with `reason: "denied"` saving nothing (Tasks 1, 3, 10), dropped on the window's end or a closed channel (Tasks 2, 3), known computers reconnect without asking (Task 1), the desktop told it waits (`onPending`, Tasks 6, 10; its words are 3b's). "Computers": `computers.json` and `safeStorage` (Task 7), one transport and runtime per computer with LAN first and the 60 s and network checks (Tasks 8-9), pairing from a relay link with `kind: "desktop"` and the Mac's name, saved after `hostAccept` (Tasks 6, 9, 10). The transport move (Task 5, with the argued exception). "Errors": every line (Task 6's copy, Tasks 6 and 10 for the codes), the 30 s offline (Task 9's `down`, Task 10's reconnect). Footer popover, Add computer, Computer settings: PR 3b. Routing, the second line, the offline cache: PR 4; remote folder picker, `media:read`: PR 5.
- **Placeholder scan.** No step leaves code out; PR 3b is a task list by design, to be planned against 3a's merged code.
- **Type consistency.** `allowComputer({ key, name, signal, waiting })` and its verdict strings match across Tasks 1-4 and the test kit; `connectPeer`'s options and `PeerError` codes match Tasks 6, 9, 10 and `computer-errors.cjs`; `ComputerView` fields match Task 9's tests and Task 10; `connectDesktopRuntime`'s `connect` matches Tasks 8-9; `lanRoutesFrom(answer, { hostId, hostKey })` matches Tasks 7 and 9.
- **Review Focus.** Each line has its test in the owning task: the held hello outliving `helloMs` (Task 1), a late Allow (Tasks 2 and 3), removal while connected (Task 10), the pre-PR 1 Mac (Task 6), an already-added or own link (Task 9).
