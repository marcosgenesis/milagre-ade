// Performance budgets on a large Project (#321): what #300 won back stays won. The Project is made up at test time
// (large-project-fixture.cjs), shaped like the big one #300 measured, so its sizes are the same on every machine and are
// held to byte budgets with a little headroom. A save's time depends on the machine and on what else runs beside it (a
// CI runner's disk is several times slower than a laptop's), so a save is held to what it writes, which is the same
// everywhere, and its time only to a loose ceiling.
//
// On the real Project these were, when this check was added: a save 6 to 7 ms, a lean desktop's state on open 2.63 MB
// before archived subagents went as summaries (0.32 MB after), a subagent update 26 KB (median). What this fixture gives
// is beside each budget. A budget that fails here means a change sends or saves more than it used to: find what grew
// before raising it.
