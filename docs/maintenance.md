# Maintenance follow-ups

These are unresolved design and maintenance topics from the October 2026 audit and [PR #146](https://github.com/the-ptf/milagre-ade/pull/146). Completed implementation plans and dated verification records were removed; their evidence remains in Git history and the merged PRs. Feature requests and acceptance criteria belong in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/the-ptf/milagre-ade/issues), as described in [the issue tracker guide](agents/issue-tracker.md).

| Area | Remaining work |
| --- | --- |
| Renderer state | Design a shared ChatStore before implementation. It should own Project snapshots, streaming runs, selection repair and Chat commands while remaining a read-only projection of core. The desktop transcript still needs virtualization; whole-state broadcasts could become delta events. |
| Shared UI behavior | Consolidate dismissal, menu keyboard navigation, dialog focus and shortcut definitions. Keep modal precedence and reduced-motion behavior explicit. Consolidate safe storage access without losing existing preferences. |
| Provider sessions | Document the session adapter contract and use one fake plus conformance tests for start, steer, interrupt, close and closed-session recovery. Review shared Codex handshake and one-shot Claude helpers. |
| Verification and packaging | Share the Electron fixture harness, route screenshots through `MILAGRE_SCREENSHOT_DIR`, and add the relevant UI checks to CI. Audit renderer-only dependencies in packaged apps. Recheck findings against current code before changing it. |
| Trust and persistence | Design a trust prompt for Project-provided Worktree setup commands. Background-only save failures still need a visible notice; explicit save boundaries already reject failures and retain dirty state for recovery. |

Mobile upload cleanup and reuse, Android validation and push-delivery limits are documented in [mobile setup](mobile-local.md). The public relay and shared desktop/mobile host are implemented; operational relay follow-ups are tracked in [issue #173](https://github.com/the-ptf/milagre-ade/issues/173).
