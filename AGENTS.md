## Agent skills

### Checks before a PR

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` and `npm test -- --unit` before opening or updating a PR. Run the Electron check for the screen you touched with `npm test -- --only <name>`.

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live in GitHub Issues. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repo. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### UI rules

Scroll containers, scrollbars and choice menus go through shared primitives. See `docs/agents/ui.md`.

### Desktop and mobile stay in sync

Every change on desktop must also be applied on mobile, and every change on mobile must also be applied on desktop, in the same task. Skip syncing only when the user explicitly says to keep the change on one platform or not to sync it.

- Inspect both implementations before editing. Keep features, behavior, copy, states and fixes in sync; use each platform's native controls and layout where appropriate.
- Prefer shared logic when it applies to both platforms. A missing counterpart is work to implement, not an automatic exemption from syncing.
- Verify the change on both platforms before declaring the task complete. If syncing is blocked, explain what remains and why. The mobile native-build approval rules below still apply; this sync rule does not authorize a new build.

### Mobile releases are OTA only

Every change to `apps/mobile` reaches phones as an over-the-air update (EAS Update) to the build already in TestFlight. A new native build is the exception, and it needs the user's approval before you write the change that requires it, not after.

- A change needs a new build when it changes the runtime fingerprint: a dependency with native code (direct, or newly linked), a config plugin, native fields in `app.json` (permissions, entitlements, icons, plugins, `ios`/`android`), or an Expo SDK upgrade. JS, TS, assets loaded at runtime and copy never do.
- If your task looks like it needs one, stop and ask first. Say what needs the build, and whether a JS-only way exists.
- A PR that changes the fingerprint strands every later OTA until a new build ships, so it is not merged without that approval either.
- Never start an EAS build, TestFlight upload or APK build on your own.

### Pull request screenshots

Every PR that changes something visible includes screenshots in its description. Take them from a real run (an Electron check under `scripts/test-*.cjs`, or the dev app) and show the before/after or each state the change adds.

Screenshots never go in the PR's own commits. They live on the `screenshots` branch, which has no shared history with `main`, holds only images and is never merged:

1. Fetch it (`git fetch origin screenshots`) and add the images in a folder named after the feature, e.g. `sidebar-resize/default.png`. Use a temporary worktree or clone so your PR branch stays untouched.
2. Commit and push to `screenshots`.
3. In the PR body, link each image by that commit's SHA so the link never moves: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-ptf/milagre-ade/<sha>/<feature>/<name>.png`.

The `scripts/test-*.cjs` checks save screenshots only when `MILAGRE_SCREENSHOT_DIR` is set; point it outside the repo, e.g. `$TMPDIR/<feature>`.
