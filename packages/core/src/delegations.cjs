// Delegations and Negotiations across Links (ADR-0002). A Delegation is a message from a Chat on one side
// of a Link to a Chat on the other, carried out by that side's own agent; the reply of the turn that took
// it comes back as the Delegation report. A Negotiation is a run of Delegations between two Chats: the
// receiving side answers in its report, which starts the requesting side's next move (another round or
// `conclude_negotiation`), until it concludes, the user stops it, or it reaches NEGOTIATION_ROUNDS.
//
// Delivery follows the receiving Chat: a message steers a turn that is working, waits while the Chat waits
// on the user (that pauses a Negotiation too), and starts a turn when the Chat is idle. A delivered message
// belongs to the turn the agent took it in, by turn id. A steer can miss the end of its turn, so a steered
// message's turn is settled a moment after it ends: a turn the agent starts by itself to run it (`continues`)
// takes it over. Records live in the global store; ones still open when Milagre starts again are cancelled,
// with a notice, as their turns are gone.
