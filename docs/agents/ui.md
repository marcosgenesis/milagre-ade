# UI rules

## Scrolling

Every scrolling list or panel is a `ScrollArea` (`apps/desktop/app/src/components/primitives/ScrollArea.tsx`). It brings vertical scroll that stays inside the container, the shared thin scrollbar and edge fades that show only while there's more to scroll that way. Pass `as="ul"` for lists, and `chainScroll` when it sits inside another scroller (tool output in the transcript, a list inside a scrolling dialog) so the wheel moves on to the outer one at the end.

- Don't add `overflow-y-auto` plus `useScrollFade` by hand, and don't restyle the scrollbar in a component. The one scrollbar look is the `::-webkit-scrollbar` block in `apps/desktop/app/src/styles.css`. Hiding a scrollbar where a custom rail replaces it (the message scroller) is fine.
- Give a scroll area a height limit. Popovers anchored above the composer get one from `useAnchoredPopover` (`height`, 360px by default); put the `ScrollArea` inside the popover's `flex flex-col overflow-hidden` panel so it takes the leftover space.

`apps/desktop/app/src/components/primitives/scroll-area-only.test.ts` fails when a component scrolls vertically without `ScrollArea`, wires fades or restyles the scrollbar itself. The only exceptions are `<pre>` code blocks, which scroll both ways, and the message scroller.

## Choices

Every dropdown goes through `primitives/Select`; a native `<select>` opens macOS's own menu. `no-native-select.test.ts` enforces it.

## Popovers and menus

Every transient surface (picker, menu, anchored popover) closes through `useDismiss` (`apps/desktop/app/src/lib/use-dismiss.ts`): a pointer press anywhere outside it or the window losing focus closes it; Escape stays with the component, which also returns focus. Don't add a `pointerdown` or `blur` listener of your own.

- Pass `inside` so the panel and its trigger count as the surface; the trigger's own click still toggles.
- A surface anchored to a trigger passes `follow`, its positioning function, and stays put through scrolls and resizes. A surface anchored to a point (the chat row's context menu) omits it and closes instead.
- While anything is open, `<html>` carries `data-popover-open` and the title bar's `.title-drag` strip stops dragging the window, so a press there closes the surface. Drag strips use that class, not an inline `app-region`.

Modal dialogs are different: they use `<dialog>` with `showModal` or a full-window scrim, and the scrim press closes them.

## Sliders

Every slider is a `RangeSlider` (`apps/desktop/app/src/components/primitives/RangeSlider.tsx`): tick dots per step, a bar handle that bounces as it lands, drag anywhere on the track or use the arrow keys, and no springs under reduced motion. Its value plumbing is `lib/use-slider.ts`; a native `<input type="range">` draws macOS's own control.

## Backdrop blur

Three blur strengths, all theme tokens in `apps/desktop/app/src/styles.css`:

- `backdrop-blur-overlay` (3px) on the scrim behind a dialog, palette or viewer. It softens the app behind without hiding it; pair it with a dark tint for contrast.
- `backdrop-blur-chip` (8px) on a small control that sits over media, such as the copy and download buttons on a generated image.
- `backdrop-blur-edge` (4px) where content scrolls under a window edge, faded out with a mask (`.chat-top-blur`, `.chat-bottom-blur`).

Don't use Tailwind's own sizes (`backdrop-blur-sm` to `-3xl`) or a hand-written `backdrop-filter: blur(...)`; a stronger blur behind a full-window scrim also costs frames while something animates over it. CSS that needs the value uses the variable, e.g. `blur(var(--blur-overlay))`. `primitives/backdrop-blur.test.ts` enforces it.

## Mobile activity and subagents

Use `apps/mobile/src/activity-item.tsx` for an inline item with expandable activity output. `ToolRow` and `SubagentItem` adapt domain data to `ActivityItem`; keep their icon, title, shimmer, disclosure, status spacing, accessibility and output surface in the shared component. Do not recreate those styles in an adapter.

- Pass the item icon and `state` (`idle`, `running`, `waiting`, `failed`). Running titles use the existing `ShimmerText`, which respects reduced motion and screen focus; waiting and terminal states stop it. Failures use the shared warning icon and color.
- Pass `status` when a label is needed beside the arrow. Use `disclosureOnly` for subagents so the title stays selectable and the status/arrow control expands the details. Tool activity uses the whole row; `onPress` opens its sheet from the Chat.
- Supply the output as children. The component owns its bounded, nested `PageScroll`, background, corners and padding; adapters only format content. `loading` keeps a disclosure available while tool output is fetched.
- Reuse `ActivityTitle` for activity summaries that need the same code chips and running shimmer.

Check both Activity and Subagents when changing this component: collapsed, expanded, running, waiting, failed and late-arriving output.
