 * The phones and computers paired to this Mac, oldest first, in `<dataDir>/devices.json` ({ devices, removed }, 0600).
 * `removed` keeps when each forgotten device was removed, so phone.cjs can keep it from pairing again in the window it
 * was removed in. Reset clears both. When devices.json is missing, the bare key list from before devices had names
 * (relay-phones.json) moves in as nameless phones and is deleted. Writes land in call order, so a clear is never
 * overwritten by an add that started before it. Any method may run before load(): the first one reads the file.
 *
 * A phone pairs without its owner at this Mac, so it arrives `isNew` (Settings › Devices marks it New until the owner
 * looks: `acknowledge`) and not yet `announced` (the "New phone paired" notice waits for a desktop to take it:
 * `takeNotices`, then `confirmNotices` once it showed them). Both survive restarts, so a phone that pairs while no
 * desktop is open is still told about. A computer pairs only after its owner's Allow in this Mac's window, so it is
 * neither. A taken notice is only claimed, in memory: no other window gets it while the claim holds, and it is offered
 * again if the claim is released (its connection closed), times out (CLAIM_MS) or dies with the daemon. Only the
 * confirm writes it as announced, so a reply lost on the way to the window never loses the notice.
